# Hello World in Go

This app demonstrates Stackato's "Generic framework" by deploying an application of custom framework and runtime ... in this case, the Go programming language from Google.

## Pusing to Stackato

   make clean
   stackato push -n

Go will be installed from the [Ubuntu PPA repo](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Go) during staging, which should take a bit of time dependending on the download speed.
